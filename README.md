# **Snake** 
This is my take on the classic game snake. 
I used the SFML Library and implemented several data structures and algorithms.



**LINK**

*Google Drive link for the zip that contains the executable file for this game -* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1otY55UTr5uVvZMhBwPJWoe1u_cghz71D/view?usp=sharing



## **MAIN MENU**

The game starts off with a main menu screen.
This state has two options - Play and Exit which are self explanatory.

## **GAMEPLAY**

All the elements that appear on the screen have been made by me to give the game a modern feel.

### *The game initializes with three elements:*

- **Snake**

- **Walls**

- **Grass**

- **Food (*which is a strawberry*)**

- *The snake grows in length each time it consumes food (controlled with arrow keys).*
- *The game gets over if the snake collides with the wall or self-intersects.*
- *The score updates by 20 when food is consumed (because the current price of one strawberry in my country is approximately â‚¹20).*
- *Food gets placed randomly anywhere on the screen within the walls.*





## **PAUSE STATE**

*Player can pause the game by pressing the escape key.*

## **GAME OVER STATE**

*The third state of the game is when the snake dies.*
